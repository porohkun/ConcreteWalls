    <description>By smelting stone and steel fibers of a special structure in an electric smelter, you can get ceramic concrete - a very durable material of a bluish color, which holds both static load and dynamic (projectile, explosive) damage well. Often used on the frontier worlds as a building material.
ATTENTION! Prolonged contact with uncoated ceramic concrete can lead to unpleasant consequences, such as itching, burning, redness, capillary bleeding, coughing, loss of virginity, death.</description>
